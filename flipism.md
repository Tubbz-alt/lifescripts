I should write a bit about flipism.

Flipism, the idea that life choices can be outsourced to randomness, is like all
things [the product of a Donald Duck comic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flipism).

In the comic, he becomes a fervent flipist after a snake-oil philosopher
convinces him of its merit. Donald gets in a car accident after flipping a coin
to decide whether to hit the gas or the brake, etc. It catastrophically fucks up
his life due to him making absurd decisions at the literal flip of a coin.

In the decades since, people played around with the idea. Obviously flipping a
coin for *every* decision is absurd. But are there some decisions where you'd be
better off by flipping a coin? Which decisions in fact are benefitted by
outsourcing one's executive functioning to an entropy source?

Game theorists noted that the introduction of randomness allows for mixed
strategies, ensuring Nash equilibria where previously none could exist. Flipping
a coin could literally turn an unwinnable game into one that could be beaten.

Psychologists like Daniel Kahneman, noted the cognitive strain caused by even
simple decisions, and how terrible humans are at estimating and calibrating on
probabilities. Outsourcing executive functioning can relieve that cognitive
overhead as well as produce decisions which inherently adhere to actual
probability rather than skewed and biased models.

So, there are some decisions that do in fact benefit from being outsourced to
randomness. My goal here is to explore pragmatic flipism: which decisions, in
practice, are better done by stochastic decision-making processes?
