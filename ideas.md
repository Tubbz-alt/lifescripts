In translating my routine I made some small changes. Dice kettlebell now uses
one die and a larger multiplier, etc. I could make it determine time rather than raw swings.

Hm. Say I set a weekly quota on swings, by number or by time. Each day is
randomly determined up til that quota, at which point the result defaults to 0.
