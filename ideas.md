In translating my routine I made some small changes. Dice kettlebell now uses
one die and a larger multiplier, etc. I could make it determine time rather than raw swings.

Hm. Say I set a weekly quota on swings, by number or by time. Each day is
randomly determined up til that quota, at which point the result defaults to 0.

scripts that solve the packing problem by learning the difficulty of
various tasks in the manner of Anki or Mnemosyne spaced repetition
flashcards and then mapping them to a hidden markov state of
general energy levels. Over time tasks get done, without overexerting oneself.

Idea: add gripper script to determine whether to do a set of gripper crushes.

Idea: Stochastic distribution of attention.

Basically: give yourself permission via a diceroll to not feel it necessary to
weigh in on everything at once. On average, others are saying what you want to
say, and over time you will get the chance to join them. Just not today, just
not about everything. Maybe a personal killfile for issues/events that gives you
permission to focus and not feel obligated to be torn apart by competing streams
of dystopia.

Idea: extract thirst/fuckslevel etc into a literal statsheet that those scripts
look at. Change em all in one spot. Done. Later I'll have to alter savingthrow.

cleaning.rkt: Should it be a general tasks script, or specifically for cleaning?

Idea: a CW/TW quarantine. Populate triggers.txt, and it'll process it into
various forms ready to be plopped into browser extensions and such. Pipe it to a
function that'll produce json, and connect it to rotten tomatoes and netflix to
produce a script that'll add warnings on mouse-over for movies. Connect it to
goodreads, and add nice warnings next to titles, etc. 

Should add a file for UI (or lack thereof).
