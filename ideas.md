In translating my routine I made some small changes. Dice kettlebell now uses
one die and a larger multiplier, etc. I could make it determine time rather than raw swings.

Hm. Say I set a weekly quota on swings, by number or by time. Each day is
randomly determined up til that quota, at which point the result defaults to 0.

scripts that solve the packing problem by learning the difficulty of
various tasks in the manner of Anki or Mnemosyne spaced repetition
flashcards and then mapping them to a hidden markov state of
general energy levels. Over time tasks get done, without overexerting oneself.

Idea: add gripper script to determine whether to do a set of gripper crushes.
