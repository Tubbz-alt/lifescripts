So I have been doing stochastic intermittent fasting for a while, and recently
started doing stochastic cardio.

Coinfasting: flip a coin in the morning. Heads eat, tails fast. Over 7 days the
expected value is 3.5, identical to a scheduled ADF. The randomness makes it
easier to calibrate on the right number of calories: you can't just binge
because the next few days may also be heads, and you can't do too much
restriction because the next few days may also be tails.

Coin cardio: 20 minutes cycling every morning. Heads days, an extra 30 minutes
cycling in the afternoon. 140 minutes baseline, which is the minimum suggested
dose, averages to 245 minutes, maximum 350 minutes. 450 minutes is the maximum
suggested dose of cardio beyond which diminishing returns kick in
(https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/the-right-dose-of-exercise-for-a-longer-life/).

Dice Kettlebell: What I had been doing was: roll 2d6, multiply by a number. Do that many swings. I decided to simplify this a bit by just increasing the multiplier and rolling one die. 

Basically: I am enjoying the hell out of adding all this randomness to my life.
I want to add more, hence this project.

I want to automate this stuff and make it easy to extend flipism to other parts
of my life.

What I've been doing is recording the day's results of the coinflip and dice roll in a
pinned Keep note. Note to self: check if Keep has an API that I can use to send
stuff to from racket.

I had originally envisioned simple decision scripts, some depending on the
decisions of the last week. Drink some water? How many kettlebell swings should
I do today? etc. For some reason I am now making an RPG. There's a statsheet and
a skillsheet, and whether I refactor code is based on a sanity stat. I'm gonna
go with the flow and see where it ends up.

Check out index.md to see what I'm already working on.
